# Claude Code Configuration - GitHub CLI Learning Project

## Project Overview
This is a **beginner-friendly learning project** focused on mastering Git and GitHub CLI from the ground up.

## User Context - CRITICAL
- **Complete beginner** - NOT a developer
- Needs **detailed explanations** for every step
- Requires understanding the **WHY** before the **WHAT**
- Learning Git/GitHub concepts through hands-on practice

## Teaching Approach Required
- **Break down complex tasks** into simple steps
- **Explain technical concepts** in beginner terms
- **Always explain WHY** before showing commands
- **Show practical examples** of each command
- **Provide context** for each action
- Be **patient and thorough** with explanations
- Use **simple, non-technical language**

## Project Commands
- No build process needed (static files only)
- No automated tests configured
- Primary tools: `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI)

## Learning Goals Progress
1. ‚úÖ Understand what GitHub CLI is and why it's useful
2. ‚úÖ Learn basic git concepts (repositories, commits, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Practice GitHub CLI commands with real examples
4. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED: Git Branches for SaaS Development** (Critical for SaaS development)
5. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED: Git Tags as restoration points**
6. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED: Branch merging and cleanup workflow**
7. üîÑ **NEXT TOPIC: Simple Commit Workflow** (Exploring simplest approach for solo SaaS)
8. ‚è≥ Understand GitHub Issues
9. ‚è≥ Quick overview of Actions/Workflows and Pull Requests
10. ‚è≥ GitHub Project Management features
11. ‚è≥ Build complete confidence with Git and GitHub

## Recently Completed (Git Branches & Tags Session)
**Accomplished:**
- ‚úÖ Understanding why branches protect SaaS production code
- ‚úÖ Created and worked with feature branches (`add-contact-form`)
- ‚úÖ Learned branch workflow: create ‚Üí work ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push ‚Üí merge ‚Üí delete
- ‚úÖ Mastered Git tags as restoration points (`v1.0-stable-contact-page`)
- ‚úÖ Practiced disaster recovery using tags and `git reset --hard`
- ‚úÖ Understood local vs GitHub repository synchronization
- ‚úÖ Learned difference between forks and branches
- ‚úÖ Successful merge and branch cleanup workflow
- ‚úÖ Demonstrated sync problems when editing directly on GitHub

**Key Commands Mastered:**
- `git checkout -b branch-name` (create and switch to branch)
- `git merge branch-name` (merge branch to master)
- `git branch -d branch-name` (delete local branch)
- `git push origin --delete branch-name` (delete GitHub branch)
- `git tag tag-name` (create restoration point)
- `git push origin tag-name` (push tag to GitHub)
- `git reset --hard tag-name` (restore to tag)
- `git push --force origin master` (force update GitHub)
- `git pull` (sync local with GitHub)
- `git fetch origin` (check for updates without merging)

**Real-world scenarios practiced:**
- Safe feature development using branches
- Emergency rollback using tags
- Repository synchronization issues and solutions
- Solo vs team development workflows

## Next Learning Session - START HERE
**TOPIC: Simple Commit Workflow for Solo SaaS Development**

**Why this matters:** User wants to explore the simplest possible workflow. Since every commit creates a restoration point with its SHA, maybe branches and tags add unnecessary complexity for solo development.

**What to explore:**
1. Using commit history as restoration points (no tags needed)
2. Going back 2-3 commits using commit SHAs
3. Simple workflow: edit ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push (stay on master)
4. When this approach works vs when branches are still needed
5. `git log` and `git reset` for navigation
6. Compare simplicity vs safety trade-offs

**Goal:** Determine if commit-only workflow is sufficient for simple SaaS development.

**After Simple Commits, cover:**
1. **GitHub Issues** - What they are and basic usage
2. **Actions/Workflows & Pull Requests** - Quick overview
3. **GitHub Project Management** - Built-in project features
4. **Final confidence building** - Complete Git/GitHub mastery

## Project Structure
- `README.md` - Project description
- `glossary.md` - Technical terms reference (UPDATE when introducing new concepts)
- `CLAUDE.md` - This configuration file

## Important Instructions for Claude
- Always update `glossary.md` when introducing new Git/GitHub terms
- Use TodoWrite tool to track learning progress
- Explain commands before running them
- Show what each action accomplishes
- Help user understand the bigger picture of version control
- This is a **safe learning environment** - encourage questions
- Maintain beginner-friendly pace throughout sessions

## Preferences
- Focus on practical, hands-on learning
- Visual explanations when possible
- Connect new concepts to previously learned ones
- Encourage questions and exploration
