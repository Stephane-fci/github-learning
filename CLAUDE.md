# Claude Code Configuration - GitHub CLI Learning Project

## Project Overview
This is a **beginner-friendly learning project** focused on mastering Git and GitHub CLI from the ground up.

## User Context - CRITICAL
- **Complete beginner** - NOT a developer
- Needs **detailed explanations** for every step
- Requires understanding the **WHY** before the **WHAT**
- Learning Git/GitHub concepts through hands-on practice

## Teaching Approach Required
- **Break down complex tasks** into simple steps
- **Explain technical concepts** in beginner terms
- **Always explain WHY** before showing commands
- **Show practical examples** of each command
- **Provide context** for each action
- Be **patient and thorough** with explanations
- Use **simple, non-technical language**

## Project Commands
- No build process needed (static files only)
- No automated tests configured
- Primary tools: `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI)

## Learning Goals Progress
1. ✅ Understand what GitHub CLI is and why it's useful
2. ✅ Learn basic git concepts (repositories, commits, etc.)
3. ✅ Practice GitHub CLI commands with real examples
4. ✅ **COMPLETED: Git Branches for SaaS Development** (Critical for SaaS development)
5. ✅ **COMPLETED: Git Tags as restoration points**
6. ✅ **COMPLETED: Branch merging and cleanup workflow**
7. ✅ **COMPLETED: Simple Commit Workflow** (Mastered simplest approach for solo SaaS development)
8. ✅ **COMPLETED: GitHub Issues and Projects Integration** (Professional development workflow mastery)
9. ⏳ Quick overview of Actions/Workflows and Pull Requests
10. ⏳ Advanced GitHub Project Management features
11. ⏳ Build complete confidence with Git and GitHub

## Recently Completed (Git Branches & Tags Session)
**Accomplished:**
- ✅ Understanding why branches protect SaaS production code
- ✅ Created and worked with feature branches (`add-contact-form`)
- ✅ Learned branch workflow: create → work → commit → push → merge → delete
- ✅ Mastered Git tags as restoration points (`v1.0-stable-contact-page`)
- ✅ Practiced disaster recovery using tags and `git reset --hard`
- ✅ Understood local vs GitHub repository synchronization
- ✅ Learned difference between forks and branches
- ✅ Successful merge and branch cleanup workflow
- ✅ Demonstrated sync problems when editing directly on GitHub

**Key Commands Mastered:**
- `git checkout -b branch-name` (create and switch to branch)
- `git merge branch-name` (merge branch to master)
- `git branch -d branch-name` (delete local branch)
- `git push origin --delete branch-name` (delete GitHub branch)
- `git tag tag-name` (create restoration point)
- `git push origin tag-name` (push tag to GitHub)
- `git reset --hard tag-name` (restore to tag)
- `git push --force origin master` (force update GitHub)
- `git pull` (sync local with GitHub)
- `git fetch origin` (check for updates without merging)

**Real-world scenarios practiced:**
- Safe feature development using branches
- Emergency rollback using tags
- Repository synchronization issues and solutions
- Solo vs team development workflows

## Recently Completed Session (September 24, 2025)

**GitHub CLI Commands Mastered:**
```bash
# Authentication and permissions
gh auth status                                    # Check current authentication
gh auth refresh --hostname github.com -s project # Add specific scopes

# Issue management
gh issue list                                     # View all repository issues
gh issue view [number]                            # View detailed issue information
gh issue create --title "Title" --label "type"   # Create professional issues

# Project integration
gh project list --owner [username]               # List all projects
gh project view [number] --owner [username]      # View project details
gh project item-add [project] --url [issue-url]  # Add issues to projects
gh project item-list [project] --owner [username] # View project contents
```

**Professional Issues Created (12 Total):**
- **Bug Issues (3):** Mobile responsiveness, contact form validation, security audit
- **Enhancement Issues (8):** User auth, pricing page, dashboard, performance, dark mode, CI/CD, newsletter, documentation
