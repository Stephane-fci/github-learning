# Claude Code Configuration - GitHub CLI Learning Project

## Project Overview
This is a **beginner-friendly learning project** focused on mastering Git and GitHub CLI from the ground up.

## User Context - CRITICAL
- **Complete beginner** - NOT a developer
- Needs **detailed explanations** for every step
- Requires understanding the **WHY** before the **WHAT**
- Learning Git/GitHub concepts through hands-on practice

## Teaching Approach Required
- **Break down complex tasks** into simple steps
- **Explain technical concepts** in beginner terms
- **Always explain WHY** before showing commands
- **Show practical examples** of each command
- **Provide context** for each action
- Be **patient and thorough** with explanations
- Use **simple, non-technical language**

## Project Commands
- No build process needed (static files only)
- No automated tests configured
- Primary tools: `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI)

## Learning Goals Progress
1. ‚úÖ Understand what GitHub CLI is and why it's useful
2. ‚úÖ Learn basic git concepts (repositories, commits, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Practice GitHub CLI commands with real examples
4. üîÑ **NEXT TOPIC: Learn Git Branches** (Critical for SaaS development)
5. ‚è≥ Understand GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests, etc.)
6. ‚è≥ Build confidence working with command line tools

## Next Learning Session - START HERE
**TOPIC: Git Branches for SaaS Development**

**Why this is critical:** User's goal is to build a SaaS without breaking everything. Branches are the #1 skill that prevents "accidentally breaking production" and enables proper engineering workflows.

**What to cover:**
1. Why branches are essential for SaaS (protect main code)
2. Create and switch between branches
3. Feature branch workflow practice
4. Safe merging strategies
5. Pull requests for code review

**Real-world context:** Branch = safe copy to build features, main branch = working app for users
