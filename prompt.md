# GitHub CLI Learning Project - Beginner Instructions

## Important Context
- **I am NOT a developer** - I'm a complete beginner
- I need **detailed explanations** for every step
- **Explain WHY we do each action**, not just what to do
- **Explain HOW each command works**
- Walk me through GitHub CLI features step by step

## Learning Approach Needed
- Break down complex tasks into simple steps
- Explain technical concepts in beginner terms
- Show me practical examples of each GitHub CLI command
- Help me understand the purpose behind each action
- Be patient and thorough with explanations

## Current Status
- Created a basic project folder with README.md
- Need to learn GitHub CLI from the ground up
- Want to understand git workflows and GitHub integration
- Ready to learn through hands-on practice

## Learning Goals
1. Understand what GitHub CLI is and why it's useful
2. Learn basic git concepts (repositories, commits, etc.)
3. Practice GitHub CLI commands with real examples
4. Understand GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests, etc.)
5. Build confidence working with command line tools

## Teaching Style Requested
- Always explain the "why" before the "what"
- Use simple, non-technical language
- Provide context for each command
- Show me what each action accomplishes
- Help me understand the bigger picture of version control and collaboration

This is a safe learning environment where I can ask questions and learn at my own pace.
